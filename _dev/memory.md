Memory update (vasora-designer-week2-onboarding):

- onboarding.vasora added: a 3-step onboarding to collect store name, products, and checkout config.
- Suggested visual assets created under assets/vasora/ (logo and two icons + three product placeholders).
- Policy NOTE: No legacy files were modified; only new files created in _dev and assets/vasora.

If later steps require touching legacy templates, the designer will present diffs and wait for OK per POLICY NO TOUCH.
