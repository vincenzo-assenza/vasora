Designer additions (vasora-designer-week4-init):

- Created design artifacts:
  - _dev/pricing.vasora — pricing grid component with monthly/yearly toggle, accessibility notes, and asset suggestions.

  - _dev/cart-modal.vasora — accessible cart modal / slide-up sheet UX with focus trap and live regions.

Notes and constraints:
- Respected POLICY NO TOUCH: only added new .vasora files under _dev and suggested assets under assets/vasora.
- Suggested asset filenames (placeholders) included in each .vasora file’s assets-suggestions section; designer did NOT create binary assets.
- Include accessibility and reduced-motion handling; mobile-first gestures considered for slide-up sheet.
