Coder subagent handoff (week4):

Implemented components:
- src/components/pricing.vasora
- src/components/faq.vasora
- src/components/cart-modal.vasora

Added global component CSS hooks:
- assets/vasora.css

Notes:
- Components are self-contained .vasora files and add light JS hooks (cart-modal close/open).
- Did NOT modify legacy templates (POLICY NO TOUCH). If changes to legacy files are required, will present diffs and await OK.

Commit message suggestion: "feat(vasora): add pricing, faq, cart-modal components + vasora.css"
