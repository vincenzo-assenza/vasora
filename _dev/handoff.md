Designer handoff additions (vasora-designer-week2-onboarding):

- Created onboarding.vasora (3-step flow) at _dev/onboarding.vasora

  - assets/vasora/logo.svg
  - assets/vasora/icon-cart.svg
  - assets/vasora/icon-check.svg
  - assets/vasora/product-1.png
  - assets/vasora/product-2.png

Notes:
- Placeholders product-*.png are text placeholders; replace with real images before production.
- I did NOT modify legacy files. If you want these assets moved or different formats (webp, optimized PNG), tell me and I will update.
